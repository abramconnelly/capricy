* Timeline should be able to add an entry
* Timeline entries need to have an 'edit' option, maybe
  a button in the upper right hand corner.
* Timeline should have a date filter
* Timeline needs a facility to add an entry to a day
  that hasn't been added to. Options are:
  - leave it calendar
  - modal with calendar
  - default the new entry to today with some facility to
    change it in the newly created entry, either another
    date picker or a 'carousel'

* 'Add' button in the activites page needs to be in line
  with other activities and dimmed

* sql.js load slow (5-6s), look into possible alternatives
  (in-browser mongodb)
